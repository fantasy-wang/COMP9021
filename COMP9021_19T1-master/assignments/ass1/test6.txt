Sirs Matt, Michael and John were in the library. Sir Matt whispered "exactly one of Sir

Michael and I is a Knave." After some time Sir John stated "Sir Michael is a

Knave!" Quietly Sir Michael stated "I am a Knight" before storming out. The library then

closed. Outside the library Sir Michael confronted Sir Matt. Sir Matt said "Sir Michael is a

Knave" to resolve any ambiguity any eavesdroppers had.
