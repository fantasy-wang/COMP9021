"Sir Peter is a Knave," said Sir Paul. Sir Peter responded with "Sir Michael is

a Knight!" Then Sir Michael said "All of us are Knights!" Sir Paul

disagreed and said "Exactly one of us is a Knight." After some time Sir Paul

continued with "At most one of us is a Knight." Sir Michael in desperation

to prove his worthiness said "I am a Knight." Not one person acknowledged Sir

Michael. Sir Michael then lashed out by saying "Sir Paul is a Knave!" Jokingly,

Sir Peter said "Sir Michael and I are Knights." This annoyed Sir Michael. Sir

Michael then said "Sir Paul and Sir Peter are Knaves!". Sir Paul aggravated the

situation by saying "At least one of Sir Peter and Sir Michael is a

Knave." To drag things out, Sir Peter then said “Sir Michael or I is a Knight!”
