I have just met Sirs Bertha, Gelbero and Bethany! "Sirs Bertha, Gelbero, Bethany or Edna is a Knight," whispered Sir Bethany. I asked Sir Gelbero who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sirs Bertha, Gelbero, Bethany, Edna and Ronald are Knaves." Then I met Sir Bethany who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sirs Bertha, Gelbero, Bethany, Edna, Ronald or Lisa is a Knave."
