I have just met Sirs Sullivan, Sue, Casey and Ramon! "Sirs Sullivan, Sue, Casey, Ramon, Isla or Marshall is a Knave," whispered Sir Casey. Then I met Sir Casey who introduced me to his friend and told me: "all of us are Knights." "I am a Knight," whispered Sir Marshall. "Sir Roberts is a Knave," whispered Sir Isla. I asked Sir Lillian who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at least one of us is a Knave!" Then I met Sir Casey who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at least one of us is a Knight!"
