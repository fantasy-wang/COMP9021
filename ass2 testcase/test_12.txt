Yesterday, I visited Sirs Rodriguez, Elizabeth, Natalie and Raymond! "All of us are Knights," whispered Sir Greg. Sir Natalie said: "at least one of us is a Knave!" "At most one of us is a Knight," whispered Sir Raymond. Then I met Sir Adrian who introduced me to his friend and told me: "all of us are Knaves." Then I met Sir Emma who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at least one of us is a Knave!" I asked Sir Adrian who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sirs Rodriguez, Elizabeth, Natalie, Raymond, Greg, Valerie, Lonnie, Carolyn, Dawn, Jeffery, Adrian, Vincent, Joanne, Emma, Tony and Walsh are Knights." I asked Sir Vincent who he was, and he answered impatiently: "I am a Knight." I asked Sir Toni who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Bernice is a Knight!"
