I have just met Sir Kathy. Then I met Sir Jamie who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sirs Kathy or Jamie is a Knave." Sir Chester said: "exactly one of Sirs Kathy, Jamie and Chester is a Knight." Then I met Sir Lawrence who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at most one of Sirs Kathy, Jamie, Chester and Lawrence is a Knight." "All of us are Knaves," whispered Sir Ken. Then I met Sir Maria who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sirs Kathy, Jamie, Chester, Lawrence, Murphy, Ken, Charlie, Christy and Maria are Knaves." Sir Christy said: "at least one of Sirs Kathy, Jamie, Chester, Lawrence, Murphy, Ken, Charlie, Christy, Maria and Nathaniel is a Knave!"
