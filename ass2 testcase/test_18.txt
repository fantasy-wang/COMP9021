I have just met Sirs Jimmy, June and Ray. "At most one of Sirs Jimmy, June, Ray and Vivian is a Knight," whispered Sir Vivian. Then I met Sir Vivian who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knight." I asked Sir Julia who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sirs Jimmy, June, Ray, Vivian, Priscilla, Dean, Julia, Anthony and Kenneth are Knaves."
