One evening as you are out for a stroll, you walk by a doorway labeled no normals
allowed. Some people are talking inside. Curious, you listen, and you hear Sir Paul
who says: "all of us are Knaves." "Exactly one of us is a Knight," replies Sir Jenny.
As for Sir John, who is also inside, he just keeps quiet. Who is a Knight, and who
is a Knave?
