I have just seen Sirs Matthew, Donna and Annie. Sir Matthew said: "exactly one of us is a Knight." I asked Sir Shannon who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sirs Matthew, Donna, Annie, Holly and Shannon are Knights." I asked Sir Ross who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at most one of Sirs Matthew, Donna, Annie, Holly, Shannon, Megan, Ross, Russell and Deanna is a Knight." I asked Sir Megan who he was, and he answered impatiently: "exactly one of us is a Knave."
