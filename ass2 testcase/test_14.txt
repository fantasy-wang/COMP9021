Yesterday, I visited Sirs Crystal and Luis. Sir Dale said: "at most one of Sirs Crystal, Luis, Dale, Hugh and Eduardo is a Knave." Then I met Sir Crystal who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knight." Then I met Sir Catherine who introduced me to his friend and told me: "all of us are Knaves." I asked Sir Florence who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at most one of Sirs Crystal, Luis, Dale, Hugh, Eduardo, Norma, Callum, Perry, Garcia, Catherine, Isaac, Clifford and Florence is a Knave." Then I met Sir Tremblay who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sir Luis is a Knight!"
