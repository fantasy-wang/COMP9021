I have just met Sirs Shawn, Wesley, Emily and Teresa. Then I met Sir Shawn who introduced me to his friend and told me: "exactly one of Sirs Shawn, Wesley, Emily and Teresa is a Knave." I asked Sir Wesley who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at least one of Sirs Shawn, Wesley, Emily and Teresa is a Knight!" "Exactly one of us is a Knave," whispered Sir Teresa. "At most one of us is a Knave," whispered Sir Emily. "Exactly one of us is a Knave," whispered Sir Emily. Then I met Sir Vernon who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at least one of Sirs Shawn, Wesley, Emily, Teresa, Jo, Jennifer, Jamie and Vernon is a Knave!"
