I have just seen Sirs Alexander and Robin! Sir Robin said: "exactly one of us is a Knave." Then I met Sir Judith who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knight." "Exactly one of Sirs Alexander, Robin, Priscilla, Eleanor, Morton, Judith, Frances, Kirk, Miguel, Bruce and Christine is a Knight," whispered Sir Kirk.
