I have just seen Sirs Katie, Clarence, Connor and Tremblay. "I am a Knave," whispered Sir Tremblay. "Sirs Katie, Clarence, Connor, Tremblay, Esther or Judy is a Knave," whispered Sir Katie. "I am a Knave," whispered Sir Mattie. Sir Connor said: "Sirs Katie, Clarence, Connor, Tremblay, Esther, Judy, Mattie, Vernon, Rita, Alice and Danielle are Knaves."
