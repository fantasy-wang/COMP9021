I have just seen Sirs Hilda and Cecil! I asked Sir Hilda who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sirs Hilda and Cecil are Knights." Then I met Sir Deanna who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knave." Sir Hilda said: "exactly one of Sirs Hilda, Cecil, Deanna, Willard, Terry, Billy and Mark is a Knight." Then I met Sir Willard who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knave." Sir Jon said: "all of us are Knights."
