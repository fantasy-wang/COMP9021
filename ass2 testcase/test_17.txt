Yesterday, I visited Sirs Pamela, Dave and Ethan! I asked Sir Gail who he was, and he answered impatiently: "I am a Knave." Sir Dave said: "Sir Stephanie is a Knave!" I asked Sir Ellen who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at least one of Sirs Pamela, Dave, Ethan, Gail, Anne, Sophia, Alma, Stephanie and Ellen is a Knight!" Sir Brent said: "at least one of Sirs Pamela, Dave, Ethan, Gail, Anne, Sophia, Alma, Stephanie, Ellen, Brent, Liam and Jake is a Knight!"
