I have just seen Sirs Ray, Micheal and Lonnie. I asked Sir Micheal who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Brown is a Knave!" Sir Ray said: "Sir Beatrice is a Knave!" Sir Patrick said: "Sirs Ray, Micheal, Lonnie, Sarah, Beatrice, Brown and Patrick are Knaves." Then I met Sir Ray who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sirs Ray, Micheal, Lonnie, Sarah, Beatrice, Brown, Patrick, Darrell and Ernest are Knights." I asked Sir Sarah who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at least one of Sirs Ray, Micheal, Lonnie, Sarah, Beatrice, Brown, Patrick, Darrell, Ernest and Vicki is a Knave!"
