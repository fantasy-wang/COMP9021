I have just seen Sirs Elmer and April! "Exactly one of Sirs Elmer, April and Damian is a Knave," whispered Sir April. "Sirs Elmer, April, Damian and Walter are Knaves," whispered Sir Damian. Then I met Sir Gordon who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sirs Elmer, April, Damian, Walter, Christopher or Gordon is a Knave." Sir Walter said: "at least one of us is a Knave!"
