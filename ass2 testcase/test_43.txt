I have just met Sir Georgia. Then I met Sir Georgia who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at least one of us is a Knight!" "Sirs Georgia, Irma and Vivian are Knights," whispered Sir Georgia. Sir Cecil said: "exactly one of Sirs Georgia, Irma, Vivian, Cecil and Antonio is a Knight." Sir Antonio said: "Sirs Georgia, Irma, Vivian, Cecil, Antonio or Johnson is a Knave."
