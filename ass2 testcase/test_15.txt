I have just seen Sirs Nora and Harvey. Then I met Sir Nora who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knight." Then I met Sir Fernando who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at most one of us is a Knave." "I am a Knave," whispered Sir Herbert. Then I met Sir Davies who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at most one of Sirs Nora, Harvey, Davies, Brittany, Fernando, Tina, Herbert, Beverly, Teresa, Dave, Alexander and Leona is a Knave." "At least one of us is a Knight," whispered Sir Nora.
