I have just seen Sirs Ruby and Julia! "I am a Knight," whispered Sir Ruby. "I am a Knight," whispered Sir Hugh. Then I met Sir Elaine who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sirs Ruby, Julia, Miller, Erika, Hugh, Darlene, Liam and Elaine are Knights." "Sirs Ruby, Julia, Miller, Erika, Hugh, Darlene, Liam, Elaine, Ray and Naomi are Knights," whispered Sir Naomi. I asked Sir Nathaniel who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sirs Ruby, Julia, Miller, Erika, Hugh, Darlene, Liam, Elaine, Ray, Naomi, Nathaniel or Rodney is a Knave."
