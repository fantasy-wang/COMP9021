I have just met Sir Michael. Then I met Sir Michael who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at least one of Sirs Michael and Brad is a Knight!" "At least one of us is a Knave," whispered Sir Marsha. Then I met Sir David who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sirs Michael, Brad, Erin, Marsha, David or Pamela is a Knight." "Sir Wade is a Knight," whispered Sir David.
