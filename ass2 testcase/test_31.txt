Yesterday, I visited Sirs Olivia, Beverly and Williams! "At most one of us is a Knight," whispered Sir Olivia. "All of us are Knights," whispered Sir Olivia. Sir Mitchell said: "Sirs Olivia, Beverly, Williams, Fernando, Natalie and Mitchell are Knaves." Sir Peter said: "at least one of Sirs Olivia, Beverly, Williams, Fernando, Natalie, Mitchell, Linda and Peter is a Knight!" Then I met Sir Frances who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at least one of us is a Knave!"
