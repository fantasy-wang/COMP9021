Yesterday, I visited Sirs Marcia and Fred! "Sirs Marcia, Fred and Billy are Knaves," whispered Sir Marcia. Then I met Sir Rhonda who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sir Scott is a Knight!" Then I met Sir Marcia who introduced me to his friend and told me: "exactly one of us is a Knave." Sir Bonnie said: "Sir Todd is a Knight!"
