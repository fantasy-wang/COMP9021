I have just seen Sirs Marion and Lily! Sir Marion said: "at most one of Sirs Marion, Lily and Jim is a Knight." "Exactly one of Sirs Marion, Lily and Jim is a Knave," whispered Sir Marion. "All of us are Knights," whispered Sir Madison. I asked Sir Jim who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sirs Marion, Lily, Jim, Madison or Guy is a Knave." Sir Linda said: "I am a Knave."
