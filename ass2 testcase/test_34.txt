I have just seen Sirs Samantha and Erin. Sir Erin said: "Sirs Samantha and Erin are Knaves." Sir Nicholas said: "I am a Knave." Sir Terrance said: "Sirs Samantha, Erin, Nicholas, Charles, Terrance or Wendy is a Knight." Sir Erin said: "Sirs Samantha, Erin, Nicholas, Charles, Terrance, Wendy, Diana, Anna and Herbert are Knaves." I asked Sir Nicholas who he was, and he answered impatiently: "all of us are Knights." Sir Wendy said: "Sirs Samantha, Erin, Nicholas, Charles, Terrance, Wendy, Diana, Anna, Herbert, Hugh, Chris, White or Jamie is a Knave."
